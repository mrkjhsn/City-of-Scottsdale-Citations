## City-of-Scottsdale-Citations
What can the dataset of citations issued by the City of Scottsdale Police Department tell me?

As resident of Scottsdale Arizona, I'm interested in an understanding of the city I can form by combing through it's data.  I walk, I bicycle, I drive through it regularly.  I shop and grocery stores, I visit public libraries.  These daily activities have allowed me to gain an understanding of the city through direct contact.  In contrast to that understanding, what story about the city can be formed by looking at something like the citations(approximately 27K over the last year) issed by the City of Scottsdale Police Department.

#### Analysis by Location

##### Things to Consider:
+ which locations are associated with the highest numbers of citations of any given type?
+ is the higher number of citations at these locations attributable to something temporary, or permanent?


#### Analysis by Police Officer

##### Things to Consider:
+ are some officers better at enforcing certain citations?
+ am I able to identify specific reasons why some officers have a higher number of citations in a specific "charge description"?
+ is the citation issuing behavior of male officers the same as female officers?
